# ✍️ Project Reflection

## AI Tools Used
I used Perplexity Pro as my main AI assistant throughout this project. It helped me brainstorm solutions, debug code, compare API options, and learn best practices for Python libraries like `requests`, `matplotlib`, and `pyinputplus`. The AI also guided me in writing robust error handling, modular functions, and effective unit tests with mocking.

## Prompting Techniques
I applied intentional prompting by:
- Breaking down complex problems into smaller, specific questions (e.g., asking for pseudocode before code).
- Requesting code reviews and best practices for error handling and input validation.
- Challenging AI suggestions when they conflicted with API documentation (such as the 3-day forecast limit).
- Asking for practical examples and step-by-step guidance for new libraries and testing strategies.
- Using follow-up prompts to refine and improve initial AI responses.

## What Worked Well?
I am proud of how I used AI to iteratively improve my code quality and understanding. For example, I started with basic functions and, through targeted prompts, enhanced them with error handling, input validation, and clear documentation. My ability to test API-dependent code using mocking was a direct result of intentional prompting and made my project much more robust.

## What Would You Do Differently?
If I had more time, I would invest in more advanced natural language processing for user questions and write even more comprehensive unit tests. I would also plan my code structure in greater detail before starting, which would make later changes easier and more efficient.

## Final Thoughts
This project was a valuable learning experience in both Python development and AI-assisted problem solving. I gained confidence in using APIs, handling errors, and writing maintainable code. Most importantly, I learned how to collaborate with AI as a coding partner, using intentional prompting to get the best results. I feel better prepared for future projects and more complex programming challenges.
