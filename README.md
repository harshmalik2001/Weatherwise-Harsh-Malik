# 🌤 Weatherwise — Python Weather Advisor

## 📘 Overview

Weatherwise operates as a basic Python application that retrieves current weather information through the **wttr.in API**.  
Users can access daily weather forecasts and ask questions in natural speech while the application shows temperature and precipitation patterns through interactive charts.  
The project serves as an academic assignment which showcases modular code development and API management and AI-assisted development through Perplexity Pro.

## ⚙️ Features
-The application retrieves current weather information through the **wttr.in API**.
-The application manages API problems and restricts data retrieval to three days of forecasts.
-The application shows temperature and rainfall data through **matplotlib**.
-The application uses **pyinputplus** to perform user input validation.
-The application provides users with a simple menu-based command-line interface.
-The application shows how to create AI prompts while teaching the system to learn.

## 🧠 AI Assistance

The AI system (Perplexity Pro) performed the following tasks:
The system produced pseudocode and function structure for essential functions and enhanced API management and error detection systems and proposed modular programming approaches and visualization solutions and provided solutions to resolve `matplotlib` blocking problems and documented my thought process and specific prompting techniques.
