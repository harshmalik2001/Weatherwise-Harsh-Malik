Exploring weather data source options

Me: What are the pros and cons of using wttr.in versus OpenWeatherMap for my Weather Advisor assignment?
AI: wttr.in is free, simple, and does not require an API key, but only provides 3 days of forecast. OpenWeatherMap offers more detailed and longer forecasts, but requires registration and an API key.

Me: Which is easier for a beginner to implement in Python?
AI: wttr.in is easier for beginners because you can fetch data with a simple requests.get() call and parse the JSON. OpenWeatherMap requires more setup and handling of API keys.

Me: What are the limitations of wttr.in for my assignment?
AI: The main limitation is the 3-day forecast cap. If your assignment requires more days or advanced features, OpenWeatherMap is better.

# Note: This conversation helped me decide to use wttr.in for simplicity and to meet core requirements.
