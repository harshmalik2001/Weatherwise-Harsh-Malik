Why use pyinputplus instead of input()?

Me: Why should I use pyinputplus for user input instead of the built-in input() function?

AI: pyinputplus provides input validation and will keep prompting the user until they enter valid data. For example, pyip.inputInt() only accepts integers, and you can set limits, timeouts, and default values. This makes your program more robust and user-friendly.

Me: Can you show me an example?

AI: Sure!

python
import pyinputplus as pyip
age = pyip.inputInt(prompt="Enter your age: ", min=1, max=120)
print("Your age is:", age)
Me: That’s helpful! Now my program won’t crash if the user enters something invalid.

Intentional Prompting:
The purpose of this prompt was to determine the most effective methods for validating user input. 
Your request for a comparison and practical example led the AI to show the benefits of pyinputplus and provide an example of its application. 
Your project received improved user-friendly input handling through the specific guidance you received from the AI system.
